# SNAKE

Snake game made using Rust wasm.

## Getting Started

This project is hosted in github pages [https://alberto-izquierdo.github.io/snake_webassembly/](https://alberto-izquierdo.github.io/snake_webassembly/).

Although, you can play the game locally running the `setup.sh` script and openning the address specified in the command's output (default to `localhost:8000`) in a web browser.

### Prerequisites

The only dependency needed to run the game is cargo. Check the [installation instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).


## Acknowledgments

* This project is based on [tensor-programming's repository](https://github.com/tensor-programming/rust_wasm_bindgen_intro), but adding CI, deployment and some changes in the code.
